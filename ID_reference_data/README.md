# Tuning Data Construction

We construct visual instruction tuning data with ID reference based on VCR, RefCOCO, Flickr30k and MovieNet.

We release the data processing code that transforms original data to instruction tuning data.

For MovieNet, we use GTP4v to annotate question-answer pairs and captions data.

The generated tuning data can be downloaded from [here]().
